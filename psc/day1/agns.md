# AGN catalogs

Neven wants to also try this other AGN catalog, that was recently released:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01505

https://quasars.org/milliquas.fits.zip

First time around, we used this one:

http://quasar.astro.illinois.edu/paper_data/DR16Q/

(http://quasar.astro.illinois.edu/paper_data/DR16Q/dr16q_prop_May16_2023.fits.gz)

It had the benefit of being based solely on SDSS astrometry, so it could be matched
really easily to that catalog (we think *wink*).

But these catalogs are pretty easy to get, so it's not a huge deal to hipscat them both, right?
